## Path 2 Data Set
    The data set that will be discussed and analyzed within this report is data set 2: Bike Traffic.  The data given through this path is a csv file including sensor data in 8 different categories separated by date.  These categories of data include high temperature of the day, low temperature of the day amount of precipitation, the total number of bikers on the Brooklyn bridge, Manhattan bridge, Williamsburg bridge, and Queensboro bridges respectively, and the total number of bikers on all four bridges during the one-day period combined.  This amount of sensor data will be used to answer analysis questions 1-3 and make predictions regarding the behavior of bikers around the bridge.
